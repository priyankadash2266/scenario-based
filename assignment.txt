Q- There are 3 kingdoms A, B, and C. The army of this kingdom has NA, NB, and NC soldiers respectively.
You are given that an army with X soldiers can defeat an army with Y soldiers only if X>Y.
An army is said to be dominant if it can defeat both the other armies combined. For example, kingdom C's army will be dominant only if NC>NA+NB.
Determine whether any of the armies is dominant or not.

solution:


#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	
	int i,T;
	scanf("%d",&T);
	for(i=1;i<=T;i++)
	{
	    int na,nb,nc;
	    scanf("%d%d%d",&na,&nb,&nc);
	    if((na>nb+nc)||(nb>na+nc)||(nc>na+nb))     // if kingdom b army will be able to defeat kingdom a and c army or kingdom a army will be able to defeat kingdom b and c army or
	    {                                          // or if kingdom c army will be able to defeat a and b 
	        printf("YES\n");
	    }
	    else
	    printf("NO\n");
	}
	return 0;
}
